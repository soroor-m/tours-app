## Tours App

This project was inspired by a need to manage travel destinations in an easy and organized way. 
The implementation follows the React best practices and demonstrates concepts such as state management and data fetching.
Tours App provides an interface to browse through a list of tours, read more about each destination, and manage the list of tours effortlessly.

With Tours App, you can:

View list: Easily access all available tours, including their images, names, prices, and descriptions.
Remove tour: Remove a tour from the list if you're not interested.
Read more: Expand the tour description to read more details.
Re-fetch tours: Refresh the list of tours.
